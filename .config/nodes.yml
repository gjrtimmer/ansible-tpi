# This key allows you to define the hosts that will be added to the /etc/hosts file.

# The key is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has the following keys:
# - ip: The IP address of the host.
# - dns: The DNS name of the host, multiple DNS names are separated by a space.
#
# Example:
#
# hosts:
#   - ip: 192.168.0.x
#     dns: "server alternate-dns"

# The key is a dictionary where the key is the sysctl parameter and the value is the value of the parameter.
# When set in this file `nodes.yml` it will apply to all nodes in the inventory of the group `nodes`.
#
# The defaults are loaded from the `roles/server/defaults/main.yml` file.
