# Hosts Configuration
#
# This key allows you to define the hosts that will be added to the /etc/hosts file.
# This is useful when you want to add a hostname to an IP address that is not defined in the DNS server.
# The key is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary has the following keys:
# - ip: The IP address of the host.
# - dns: The DNS name of the host, multiple DNS names are separated by a space.
#
# Example:
#
# extra_hosts:
#   - ip: 192.168.0.x
#     dns: "server alternate-dns"

# sysctl configuration
# With the systctl configuration you can set sysctl parameters.
# The key is a dictionary where the key is the sysctl parameter and the value is the value of the parameter.
# When set in this file `nodes.yml` it will apply to all nodes in the inventory of the group `nodes`.
#
# The defaults are loaded from the `roles/server/defaults/main.yml` file.
#
# sysctl:
#   vm.swappiness: 3

# env_vars are environemnt variables that will be set in the /etc/environment file.
# The key is a dictionary where the key is the environment variable name and the value is the value of the environment variable.
# When set in this file `nodes.yml` it will apply to all nodes in the inventory of the group `nodes`.
#
# Example:
#
# env_vars:
#   MY_ENV_VAR: "my value"

# Select the Container Runtime
# The container_runtime key allows you to select the container runtime that will be installed on the nodes.
