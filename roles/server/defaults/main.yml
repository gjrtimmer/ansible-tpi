sysctl:
  # swappiness
  # The vm.swappiness parameter controls the kernel's preference for swapping out runtime memory
  # as opposed to dropping pages from the system cache.
  # It's a value from 0 to 100, where a lower value means less swapping and a higher value means more aggressive swapping.
  # Value 3 means: 3% memory is free, 97% memory is used (100-3)
  # start swapping when 97% of the memory is consumed
  vm.swappiness: 3

  # ip_forward
  # If the Linux server is acting as a firewall, router, or NAT device,
  # it will need to be capable of forwarding packets that are meant for other destinations (other than itself).
  # Needed for docker / orchastrators
  net.ipv4.ip_forward: 1

  # tcp_syncookies
  # This parameter can help to prevent SYN flood DDoS attacks by testing the validity of the SYN packets.
  # For security reasons it is recommended to enable the parameter.
  # Note that the process is conducted without consuming memory or connection resources
  net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies: 1

  # ignore_broadcasts
  # A ping broadcast is used to see what hosts in LAN are up, but there are other ways to do this.
  # It is safer to disable this option because ICMP (ping) broadcasts and multicasts are usually a sign of Smurf attack.
  net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts: 1

  # accept_redirects
  # The parameter allows to enable or disable ICMP redirects acceptance.
  # ICMP redirects are important to routers, but can create security problems for servers,
  # so it is recommended to set the parameter to off.
  net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects: 0

  # accept_source_route
  # Tells netfilter to accept or decline source routed packets. S
  # Source routed packets are security risk, because they can can allow routing packets through an untrusted or insecure interface.
  net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route: 0

  # rp_filter
  # This parameter controls reverse path filtering, which tries to ensure packets use legitimate source addresses.
  # When is turned on it can prevent some IP spoofing attacks.
  net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter: 1

  # log_martians
  # The parameter allows to keep track of packets which could potentially indicate an attack on server.
  # This packets are those that includes impossible IP addresses, bad source routing, bad redirect packets and others.
  net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians: 1

  # send_redirects
  # Enables or disables ICMP redirects which are used mainly by routers to send out ICMP redirects to other hosts.
  # For security reasons, it is recommended to disable this option.
  net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects: 0

  # fin_timeout
  # Tells Netfilter how much seconds keep sockets in FIN-WAIT-2 state which means that connection is closed,
  # and the socket is waiting for a shutdown from the remote end.
  # Decreasing the value to 30 can avoid some DDoS attacks or other problems that arose from getting huge amounts of connections
  net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout: 30

  # tcp_keepalive_time
  # Tells the Netfilter how often to send TCP keepalive packets to keep an connection alive if it is currently unused.
  # The value 1800, or 30 minutes, is a good value for most servers.
  net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time: 1800
