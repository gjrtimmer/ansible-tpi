# When this is set to 'true' the Bootstrap role will skip any
# task after the initial bootstrap. This is due to the fact that the IP number of the Node
# configured in `host_vars` is not yet assigned by DHCP reservation.
# Therefor the tasks which checks that the node comes online after the bootstrap will
# fail. This option is used to boot the node after bootstrap so the user
# can configure DHCP reservation in there network and assign the IP
# number that the user configured in the 'host_vars'.
#
# This option will effectivly 'end' the playbook.
# In the case of a Turing RK1, as stated before, because all tasks
# after bootstrap will cease, the RK1 Install-2-NVMe will also not run.
#
# When using this option it is wise to rerun the bootstrap after
# a DHCP reservation has been made.
