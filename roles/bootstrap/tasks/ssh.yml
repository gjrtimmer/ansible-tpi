# We are generating keys in /home/vscode in the container
# this is due to the fact that we might be dealing with a devcontainer
# on a Windows host.
#
# In this case we have an issue because the /usr/bin/attr
# which is responsible for file attributes returns an error due to the fact
# that the filesystem on Windows does not support this.
#
# We are working around this because we NEED the generated SSH Key to be safely stored
# on the host machine, so it is protected against any loss.
#
# The suppression on 'risky-file-permissions' warning of ansible is deliberate
# this is to ensure correct copy to Windows hosts
